##Build with

[![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-16-blue.svg)](https://reactjs.org/) - React Query, React Router, Recharts, React hook form and more libs.

[![Supabase](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supabase-1.0.0-blue.svg)](https://supabase.io/)

##How to run
Supabase shuts down the database after 2 weeks of inactivity so the project will probably not function properly.

```git clone https://github.com/JudiJudi6/the-wild-oasis.git```
